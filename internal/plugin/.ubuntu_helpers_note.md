# ubuntu_helpers.sh

This file is a copy of `../../scripts/ubuntu_helpers.sh` that is embedded into the compiled binary.

It exists here because Go's `//go:embed` directive requires embedded files to be in the same directory or subdirectories of the package that embeds them (it cannot use `..` to go up directories).

## Keeping in Sync

When updating `scripts/ubuntu_helpers.sh`, remember to also update this copy:
```bash
cp scripts/ubuntu_helpers.sh internal/plugin/ubuntu_helpers.sh
```

Or use a build script/Makefile to automate this.
